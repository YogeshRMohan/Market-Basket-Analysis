# Objective 
Grocery is an especially attractive sector. The number of grocery shoppers and the
frequency of grocery shopping has been increasing. In order to provide higher
customer satisfaction and increase the probability of a product getting sold, it is
important to have a good knowledge of customer buying pattern. This will provide
insights about product recommendations and product bundling (which products to
be grouped on the shelves). Since, the transaction database might be incredibly large,
an analytical tool is required to work on the dataset and provide meaningful insights.
